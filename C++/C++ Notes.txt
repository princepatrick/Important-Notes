Difference between code snippets
	Snippet 1:
		vector<int> valueTemp = ans[level-1];
					
		valueTemp.push_back( value );
					
		ans[level-1] = valueTemp;
		
	Snippet 2:
		ans[level-1].push_back( value );
        
	
	In snippet 1, 
		we are actually creating a copy of the vector<int> from ans[level-1]
		This copy is created in a new memory location with a new address.
		When we push_back we are adding a new value into this memory
		This does not update the value in the original ans[]
	
	In Snippet 2,
		We are directly accessing the memory location of ans[] and are making the updates.
		Hence, we are directly updating the data in the new location. 
		This updates the value in the original ans[]
		
Why to use the following snippet 1 instead of snippet 2, even if the vector<int> nums is not going to be updated.
	Snippet 1:
		perform_func( int ind, vector<int>& nums ){ //Note the & address of operator is added
			if( SOME_BASE_CONDITION ){
				return;
			}
			
			//Perform a recursive function call of perform_func() but you do not need update vector<int> nums as part of it.
			perform_func( ind+1, nums );
		}
		
	Snippet 2:
		perform_func( int ind, vector<int> nums ){ //Note the & address of operator is NOT added
			if( SOME_BASE_CONDITION ){
				return;
			}
			
			//Perform a recursive function call of perform_func() but you do not need update vector<int> nums as part of it.
			perform_func( ind+1, nums );
		}
	
	The thing is each time we call a recursive we send the vector<int> num into the perform_func() method. 
	If the address of operator is used as in Snippet 1 then we save the space and reuse the same space, since there are no update calls happening your function will not impacted. This will save a lot of memory.
	If the address of operator is not used as in Snippet 2, then we create a new copy each time the perform_func is called which can happen a lot of times in a recursive function that is very deep. This consumes a lot of memory.
	In CP problems, we might face Memory limit exceeded issues if we use the snippet 2.
